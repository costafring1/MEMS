Experiment: rate dependent transitions in the Rijke tube
Date: 11.11.2019
Experiments performed by Induja
-------------------------------------------------
Experimental conditions:

separately acquired pressure and output of heater using 2 DAQs
Mass flow rate of air= 100 SLPM
sampling frequency fs= 10 kHz for most of the cases except for a few very slow rates
pressure transducer: PCB103B02, 
    sensitivity: 217.5 mV/kPa
    voltage limits of the pressure transducer: -5 to 5V

..................................
Control parameter:

We vary the voltage to the heater linearly from 0 V to 2.4 V in different time duration.
Final voltage, Vf= 2.4V, Initial voltage, Vi= 0, 
Rate (R) is mentioned in mV/s for each 'txt' files
...................................
Details of each data:

The first column is time and the second column is the acoustic pressure.
The conversion factor to convert pressure to pascal is (1000/0.2175)
Thus, the second multiplied column multiplied by (1000/0.2175) will give pressure in Pa
