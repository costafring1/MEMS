Experiments performed by Induja
-------------------------------------------------
Experimental conditions:

Mass flow rate of air= 100 SLPM
sampling frequency fs= 10 kHz

Each text file contains pressure data acquired at a constant voltage. 
The converted voltage (in Volts), current (in Ampere) and heater power (in Watt) corresponding to each text file are given in the 'control parameter' folder.

The files upto '10.txt' do not have transition to limit cycle oscillations (LCO) and 11-19 are LCOs.
